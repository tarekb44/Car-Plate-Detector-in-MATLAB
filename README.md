This  script processes an image to detect and extract the license plate area. It starts by converting the image to grayscale and extracting a region of interest where the license plate is likely located. The script then applies thresholding to create a binary mask, followed by morphological operations like hole filling and median filtering to reduce noise. Connected components in the binary mask are labeled, filtered based on area, and examined for orientation. The bounding box of the detected region is used to extract and display the license plate area from the image.
